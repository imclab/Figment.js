# Figment.js

Figment is a framework for importing-exporting 3D object files in NodeJS.
Specifically, it contains an simple, intermediary data type that allows all
optimization to occur in the Importer/Exporter of the file format, so that all
optimizations occur outside of the main class. This allows easy conversion
between object types.

This powers online file converters and WebAPIs, as well as a command-line tool:
`figure`.
